  Dynamically create and append a search component.

  When the "Search" button is clicked, the list of students is filtered to match the search value. For example if the name Phillip 
is typed into the box, list all students whose name or email includes Phillip.

  For example: if 10 or fewer results are returned, 0 or 1 pagination links are displayed. If 22 search results are returned, 
  3 pagination links are displayed.

- #4: If no matches are found by the search, include a message in the HTML to tell the user there are no matches.
